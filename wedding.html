      Lorcan and Edie (or Erica, if you knew her before 2011) are very much looking forward to sharing their wedding with you at the Barbican Centre Conservatory.
      Please arrive between 3:00 & 3:30pm. The Barbican is a beautiful and iconic estate - for those who haven't been before, we reccommend finding some time to have a look around.
      There will of course be plenty of time to take in the bountiful, botanic beauty of the conservatory before, during, and after the ceremony.

  <p> There will be a cocktail reception, wine with the meal, and a champagne toast provided, as well as a cash bar. Please indicate if you'd like a vegetarian option or have any dietary restrictions in your <a href='rsvp.html'class='active'><u>RSVP</u></a>.
   Dress code is semi-casual and ties are optional. We sadly have a 23:30 curfew but there are loads of good clubs nearby in Shoreditch, Farringdon, and, our neck of the woods, Dalston.

  <p>The nearest tube station is the eponymoulsy named 'Barbican', which can be reached by the Circle, Hammersmith & City, and Metropolitan lines. For the 'die-hards', the nearest night tube would be the Central Line from St Paul's.
    For those outside of London, we reccommend getting the <a href='https://citymapper.com/london'class='active'target='blank'><u>CityMapper App</u></a>. to help get you around town on public transport and Uber is always and option. The Barbican and Conservatory is wheelchair accessible.
